# Requirements
For the example, a version of the FCF framework is required at least 1.1.50

# How to start
1. Install FCF framework (https://fcf-framework.mywire.org/download/fcf/install)
2. Go to the example directory<br>
$ cd [PROJECT]
3. Initialize the sample database<br>
$ fcfmngr create-db ./fcf-example-moving-containers.js<br>
4. And run<br>
